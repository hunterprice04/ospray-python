# OSPY - Python bindings for OSPRay

These are experimental Python 3.x bindings for [OSPRay](https://www.ospray.org).
Originally just to try out [pybind11](https://github.com/pybind/pybind11),
but they are pretty useful in their current state, as Pybind11 is an amazing little
library (inpsired by the just-as-great Boost.Python).
